# ElenaTempleAutoSplitter
AutoSplitter Script made for The Adventures of Elena Temple
An Autosplitter script is a script made for livesplit, which tells the program what the memory addresses of certain variables are, 
along with using information about those variables to tell hte program when to split. I found the memory addresses using CheatEngine.
